# FraudTek

FraudTek is a java based game engine eveloped with the LWJGL library. This library is powerful and provides bindings for many common Libraries such as OpenGL or OpenAL. FraudTek integrates with these wrappers, and it istelf then wraps these functions and classes into Scriptable objects through the use of the JavaX Javascript Interpreter. 

Script games completely with uncompiled Javascript. These files are compiled at runtime so games can be created, altered and changed without compiling anything. The Engine itself can be wrapped in an executable with the help of Launch4J to release esecutable game files. 

Write Shaders with Json and glsl.

This engine will only get more powerfull with time.
